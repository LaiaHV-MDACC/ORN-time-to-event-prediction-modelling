# ORNJ Survival Modeling with Weibull AFT

This repository contains code for developing and validating a Weibull Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) model to estimate the time-to-onset of osteoradionecrosis of the jaw (ORNJ) in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients treated with radiation therapy.

## Dataset

The code is designed to be used with the dataset available via Figshare:

https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.26240435

This dataset includes a large, longitudinal cohort of HNC patients with detailed demographic, clinical, and dosimetric variables, along with structured follow-up and ORNJ event data.

Please ensure the dataset is downloaded and properly loaded before running the code in this repository.
